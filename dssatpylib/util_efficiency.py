    Performs Willmott (1981) Index of Agreement
    Willmott (1981) proposed an index of agreement (d) as a standardized measure
    of the degree of model prediction error which varies between 0 and 1. 
    The index of agreement represents the ratio of the mean square error and 
    the potential error. The agreement value of 1 indicates a perfect match, 
    and 0 indicates no agreement at all. The index of agreement can detect 
    additive and proportional differences in the observed and simulated means 
    and variances; however, d is overly sensitive to extreme values due to the 
    squared differences.

    Performs Kling-Gupta efficiency
    This goodness-of-fit measure was developed by Gupta et al. (2009) to provide
    a diagnostically interesting decomposition of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency
    (and hence MSE), which facilitates the analysis of the relative importance 
    of its different components (correlation, bias and variability) in the
    context of hydrological modelling Kling et al. (2012), proposed a revised
    version of this index, to ensure that the bias and variability ratios are 
    not cross-correlated.
